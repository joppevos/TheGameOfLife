# The Game Of Life
A non-optimized version of the game of life. An evolution game determined by the first planted seed.
"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway"
## How?
To get started just fork or copy the `life.py` content.
The script is written with numpy and matplotlib. 
pip install them both this way.

`pip install matplotlib numpy`

In the dictionary seeds you can find all the names of the containing seeds.
Place the seed in the universe by calling the name. 
example: `strseed = 'pentadecathlon'`

parameters to set:
- set the size `n = 100` for the grid size. (go easy on the size)
- set the interval `interval=500` in milliseconds between each generation.

### To-do
Optimize the loop.

The game is made for a 2D array, but would also be possible in 3D. 
When I find the time I will try to make a setup in Cinema 4d. 
The number of possible neighbours will be 25 instead of 8, so there have to be some adjustment to the 'rules'.
